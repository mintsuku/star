## Usage  

### Extracting Files  

To extract files from a .gz tar archive, use the following command:  

```bash  
star -gz <FILE>  
```  

Replace `<FILE>` with the path to the tar archive you want to extract. This command is for extracting files from gzipped.


To extract files from a .xz tar archive, use the following command:  

```bash  
star -xz <FILE>  
```  
Replace `<FILE>` with the path to the tar archive you want to extract. This command is for extracting files from xzipped.

### Searching for Files   

To search for files within a directory by keyword, use the following command:  

```bash   
star -search <KEYWORD>    
``` 

### Getting help


To get help, use the following command:
```
star -h
```
